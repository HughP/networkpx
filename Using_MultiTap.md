**MultiTap does not include T9.**

[MultiTap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-tap) is a text entry system for classical phones. MultiTap only uses the number pad, and by tapping the same key repeatedly you can enter alphabets.

Note that I haven't officially submitted MultiTap to any repository, so the one you are using right now is very probably unstable. Use with care.

MultiTap is created for [issue 36](https://code.google.com/p/networkpx/issues/detail?id=36). The output sequence is based on the Nokia 6030.
