# Introduction #

5 Row QWERTY is a QWERTY keyboard with the row of numbers, just like a standard QWERTY keyboard found in your computer. The symbols are also arranged to look like that of a computer keyboard, instead of the custom arrangement in the iPhone. It also features some commonly used functional keys and a NumPad.

(Internally, 5 Row QWERTY is a demonstration of the advanced features of layout.plist and how to mix layout.plist with custom layout.)

# Functional keys #

The keys available in 5-Row QWERTY are:
  * ←, ↑, →, ↓: **Directional keys**. Move the cursor left, up, right and downwards. Hold the key to move repeatedly.
  * **Tab**: Inserts a tab (\t) character.
  * **Esc**: Causes the current input field to lose the focus, and usually hides the keyboard as a result.
  * **Del**: also known as **Forward delete**. Remove the character immediately after the cursor. Hold the key to keep deleteing.
  * **Home**, **End**: Move the cursor to the beginning or end of text field.
  * **PgUp**, **PgDn**: Move the cursor one page up or down.

# Known issues #
  * The up, down, page up and page down keys does not work in UIWebView (Safari) ([issue 58](https://code.google.com/p/networkpx/issues/detail?id=58)).
